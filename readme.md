This project aims to connect individuals with shared interests through a chat platform that offers audio and file sharing capabilities. With the ability to create live sessions, users can easily connect with others and stay informed about new opportunities within their community. Additionally, this platform includes a library feature, where users can access and share relevant documents related to their interests.

This project encompasses the backend development of the application, including the creation of REST APIs for both the mobile application and the user management admin panel. As a prototype, this project serves as a foundation for future expansion and improvements.
